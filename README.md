# Crons
These are Automated scripts for domain server management are just for representation purposes from the company which I have worked in.
To know the details of the scripts and how they were implemented please contact me at the profile email id.

The scripts include 
•	Integrated automated crons (scripts) to report the system status of the server and domain. 
• The defacement application report, corrupt database check report, 
• file permission check on server files system, 
• speed test for servers
• AWS CloudWatch and integrated a server cpanel emails cron which bears reports to the server emails for the cpanel remote servers through the Secure Shell connection while recording it in a EAV (Entity Attribute Value) based traditional, relational database and representation on HighCharts JS.

All the scripts are written in CodeIgniter Framework, though all teh scripts are uploaded it just for teh representation purposes for the work done as a PHP developer.
